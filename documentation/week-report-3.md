# Week 2

Time spent this week: 1h

## What I did this week

Added some tests to the solver and started to write JavaDoc comments. 

## Project progress

This week was very busy and I didn't get much done. 

## What I learned this week

About JavaDoc comments and the automatic generation of them. 

## Problems

This week I didn't face any major issues that would need help from instructors. 

## What to do next

Next week I hope I can get the main algorithm optimal enough to solve 4x4 grids in a reasonable time.
