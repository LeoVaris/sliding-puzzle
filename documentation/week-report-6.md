# Week 6

This week was extremely busy, with the launch of the new course feedback system, and getting a fever from the Covid-vaccine. 
Due to that, I wasn't able to make practically any progress this week. 

Next week before the final submission I will write the required documentation and make finishing touches to the algorithm and tests.
