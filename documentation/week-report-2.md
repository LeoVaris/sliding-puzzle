# Week 1

Time spent this week: 3h

## What I did this week

Implemented the main IDA* algorithm using manhattan distance as the heuristic. Also added some tests for the new features. 

## Project progress

As described above, I implemented the core logic of the program. Currently the program can solve 3x3 grids in a reasonable amount of time. 

## What I learned this week

This week I learned a lot about IDA* and its implementation details.

## Problems

This week I didn't face any major issues that would need help from instructors. 

## What to do next

Next week I will continue to work on the main logic and try to optimise it more.
