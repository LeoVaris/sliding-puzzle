## The problem

Goal of this project is to implement a solver for the sliding puzzle. Most common variant of this is the [15 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).
In the beginning the project will focus on the 15 puzzle. If there's is enough time, it may be expanded to larger puzzles. 

## Input

The program will receive the puzzle grid as the input. It will be used to form the shortest sequence of moves to solve the puzzle. 

## Target time complexity

Finding the shortest sequence of moves is a NP-hard problem. Therefore there is no single target for a time/space complexity.

## Algorithms

The main algorithm used is IDA*, which is used for the move searching. There are few options for the heuristics.

- Manhattan distance. It is a simple way to compute the heuristic, but is does not provide a very useful value. 
- Walking distance. It is a heuristic made by Ken'ichiro Takahashi. It offers a lot more useful value to be used in pruning. 
  Problem with implementing the walking distance is that the explanation is offered only in Japanese, so using it may fail due
  to problems with translating the material.
