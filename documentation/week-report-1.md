# Week 1

Time spent this week: 3h

## What I did this week

This week I read some articles on the required algorithms and setup the development environment. 
The development environment uses JUnit for testing ja Jacoco for test coverage reporting. All tests are run
also in Github, and coverage reports are sent to Codecov. Coding style is enforced by checkstyle, which is also
run in Github. 

## Project progress

As described above, I setup the development environment this week. 

## What I learned this week

This week I learned more about the sliding puzzle problem and its possible solutions. Also spent some time reading about
related problems (for example finding _some_ solution).

## Problems

This week I didn't face any major issues that would need help from instructors. 

## What to do next

Next week I will begin to work on the main IDA* algorithm.
