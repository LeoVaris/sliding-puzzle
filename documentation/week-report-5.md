# Week 5

Time spent this week: 5h

## What I did this week

Slightly improved the performance. Also implemented an easy way to run the performance tests

## Project progress

Now the main logic is finished. The solver is unfortunately quite slow, maybe better heuristics could improve it. 

## What I learned this week

About Gradle and how to define custom tasks

## Problems

This week I didn't face any major issues that would need help from instructors. 

## What to do next

Next week I will document the code more and create other documentation.
