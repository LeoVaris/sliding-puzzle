# Week 4

Time spent this week: 5h

## What I did this week

Created the first version of the performance tester. 

## Project progress

The project is progressing well, the core logic is mostly finished. 

## What I learned this week

About the creation of performance testers. 

## Problems

This week I didn't face any major issues that would need help from instructors. 

## What to do next

Next week I hope I can get the main algorithm optimal enough to solve 4x4 grids in a reasonable time. With the performance tester and unit tests coverage
I found possible sources for the slowness.
